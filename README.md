This Python script when run automatically fetches, processes, and creates a visualization for expected low and high tide predictions utilizing the NOAA tides and currents API. Created with the intention of helping my friend learn to swim through highlighting favorable tide conditions.
The script requests the NOAA tides and currents API, converts it into a pandas dataframe and creates a line plot using Matplotlib. 
Changing my_station_id and my_station_name variable can manipulate the visualization to different NOAA stations.
